# Note Taker 
The Note-taking App we will work on is a web application that allows the user to input text and deletes the saved notes.
## Description 

* This note taking application allows us to save notes with a title and plain text.The Note Taker app makes creating, viewing, and deleting notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
* Created a route for the NoteApp using an app.get() method. The method has a callback function that takes “request” and “responds” parameters. it renders the index.html  file and then redirects to the homepage.
* Created a route which handles the post request. Also, the POST method has a callback function that takes in the “request” and “respond” parameters. We also created an id generator for the new notes  using the Math.random() method. 
* Created a route for delete request, and  made use of the note id as well as the filter() method.
